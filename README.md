## The Problem: WordPress Upload Limits

### Error Messages You're Seeing:

```
"The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini"
"Maximum upload file size: 64MB"
"File exceeds the maximum upload size for this site"
"post_max_size exceeded"
"The uploaded file exceeds the MAX_FILE_SIZE directive"
"413 Request Entity Too Large"
Upload timeouts and browser crashes
```

### Why This Happens:

- **Shared hosting limits** - Most hosts restrict uploads to 64MB or less
- **PHP configuration** - `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` restrictions
- **WordPress limits** - Additional size restrictions in WordPress core
- **Browser limitations** - Large file uploads can crash browsers
- **Network timeouts** - Slow connections can't handle large uploads
- **Memory limits** - PHP memory exhaustion during uploads

### What You Can't Upload:

- **4K/8K Videos** - Often 500MB to 5GB+ files
- **RAW Photos** - Professional RAW files (50MB-100MB+ each)
- **Large PDFs** - Technical documents, catalogs (100MB+)
- **Bulk Product Images** - Hundreds of WooCommerce images
- **Audio Files** - High-quality music files, podcasts
- **Site Migrations** - Full media libraries with thousands of files

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I bypass WordPress upload limit?

**Answer:** Upload your file via FTP or SSH (which has no size limit), then use this plugin to import it to your WordPress Media Library. This completely bypasses the `upload_max_filesize` restriction.

### Why does WordPress say my file exceeds the maximum upload size?

**Answer:** Your hosting provider has set a `upload_max_filesize` limit (often 64MB or less on shared hosting). This plugin bypasses that limit by importing files already on your server, avoiding the WordPress upload process entirely.

### Can I upload large videos to WordPress with this plugin?

**Answer:** Yes! Upload your video file via FTP to bypass the upload limit, then import it using this plugin. Works perfectly for 4K videos, 8K videos, large PDFs, RAW photos, and any file type WordPress supports.

### Will this work with WooCommerce product images?

**Answer:** Yes! Perfect for bulk importing product images. Upload all your product images via FTP, then batch import them to Media Library. Much faster than uploading one by one.

### Can I import entire folders?

**Answer:** Yes! Simply check the checkbox next to a folder name to import all files within it, including subfolders. Great for bulk imports.

### Will this create duplicate files in my media library?

**Answer:** No. The plugin has smart duplicate detection and prevents re-importing files that already exist in your Media Library.

### Does this require server access or PHP knowledge?

**Answer:** No! You only need FTP/SSH access to upload files (which most hosting provides). No PHP configuration, no server access, no technical knowledge required.

### Is it safe for shared hosting?

**Answer:** Absolutely! No server configuration changes required. Works perfectly on shared hosting without affecting other sites.

### Can I change the directory the plugin browses?

**Answer:** Yes! You can change the root directory from the plugin settings page in WordPress admin, or add a constant to `wp-config.php`.

### What file types can I import?

**Answer:** Any file type that WordPress supports in the Media Library - images, videos, PDFs, audio files, documents, etc. The plugin blocks dangerous file types (PHP, EXE, etc.) for security.

### Does this work with WordPress multisite?

**Answer:** Yes! The plugin is fully compatible with WordPress multisite installations.
